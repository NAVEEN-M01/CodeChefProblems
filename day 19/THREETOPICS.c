//                                 The Three Topics

// The Chef has reached the finals of the Annual Inter-school Declamation contest.

// For the finals, students were asked to prepare 10 topics. However, Chef was only able to prepare three topics, numbered A, B and C â€” he is totally blank about the other topics. This means Chef can only win the contest if he gets the topics A, B or C to speak about.
// On the contest day, Chef gets topic X. Determine whether Chef has any chances of winning the competition.
